LifeLine is an Electronic Health Record application made using Flutter and Firebase Firestore. It lets users save and preserve their health record and medical history. Doctors can validate users' medical data through QR code validation. There is a separate section for Blood donors where users can find nearby blood donors according to blood group and edit their own donor profile.
